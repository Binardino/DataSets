# DataSets
Listed are a few interesting datasets for practicing Applied Machine Learning

# Classification:
## Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set:

![Breast Cancer data set](BreastCancer.jpg)

Machine learning dataset for classification problem is breast cancer diagnostic dataset. 
It’s a well-known dataset for breast cancer diagnosis system. This breast cancer diagnostic dataset is 
designed based on the digitized image of a fine needle aspirate of a breast mass. 
In this digitized image, the features of the cell nuclei are outlined.

## Features:

1. There are three types of attributes available, i.e., ID, diagnosis, 30 real-valued input features.
2. For each cell nucleus, ten real-valued features are calculated, i.e., radius, texture, perimeter, area, etc.
3. There are two types of predicting filed, i.e., benign and malignant.
4. In this database, there are 569 instances which include 357 benign and 212 malignant.

## Banknote Authentication Dataset:
![Banknote Authentication Dataset](banknote.jpg)

Another interesting machine learning dataset is the banknote authentication dataset. This dataset is 
about checking out the genuine and forged banknotes. In this dataset, data were taken from the
images of genuine and forged banknote. Moreover, the images are 400 by 400 pixels. To extract
the features from these images, a Wavelet transform tool was used.


## Features

1. There are five attributes, i.e., the variance of Wavelet Transformed image, skewness of Wavelet Transformed image,
   curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image, the entropy of image, and class.
2. It’s a classification task.
3. The number of instances is 1372.
4. There is no missing value.
